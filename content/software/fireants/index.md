The FireANTs library is a lightweight registration package for Riemannian diffeomorphic registration on GPUs.

## Features

Currently, FireANTs supports the following forms of registration:
![Registration types](fireants_features.png)

Moreover, it supports the following similarity metrics:
- Cross-correlation
- Mutual information
- Mean squared error
- Custom similarity metrics (see [Tutorial](https://github.com/rohitrango/FireANTs/blob/fireants/tutorials/%5BTutorial%202%5D%20Custom%20loss%20functions.ipynb))

FireANTs also provides functionality for saving transformations in the ANTs formats for seamless integration with existing workflows.

We also provide scripts for template building.

## Core Idea

The initial motivations were to create a GPU reimplementation of the widely used [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs) library. 
However, we improved upon the initial implementation to implement first-order adaptive algorithms (like Adam) on Riemannian manifolds, specifically for multi-scale diffeomorphisms.
