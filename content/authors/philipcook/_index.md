<!-- This text will go on top of the file, checkout the reference image -->
I am a staff scientist in the PICSL lab working on diffusion imaging, structural image
processing, and image informatics. I am interested in multi-modality imaging and the
challenges of integrating data from different sources. I am also part of the development
and maintenance team for the [ANTsX ecosystem](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs). For
technical inquiries about ANTsX, please use the issue templates or discussion forums on
the ANTsX pages, rather than emailing me directly.

I am fortunate to collaborate with a number of talented researchers and clinicians from
several groups including the [Penn FTD Center](https://www.pennftdcenter.org),
[PennLINC](https://www.pennlinc.io).

Publications are listed on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nhl7_a0AAAAJ&hl=en) page.
