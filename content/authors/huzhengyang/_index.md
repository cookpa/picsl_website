I'm a PhD student at University of Pennsylvania, co-advised by [James C. Gee](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g5455356/p10656) and [Jianbo Shi](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/). 

1. Computer Vision: segmentation, correspondence, un-supervised methods.

2. Explainbility: feature visualization, mechanistic interpretability.


I play rhythm game and instruments. My favorite: Blues Driver & Telecaster
